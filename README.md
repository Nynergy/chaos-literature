# Generative Chaotic Literature
### Nigh-incomprehensible stories written with Markov Chains in C++
---------------------------------------

This is a simple C++ implementation of a Markov Chain, used to generate arbitrary text using a supplied "corpus" of material. I am currently using it to generate a title, some section titles, and five paragraphs of text, which are output either to stdout or to a formatted LaTeX document. As it stands, you will need to supply your own corpus, by creating a directory called "corpus" at the root of the repository. After creating this directory, fill it with all manner of well-formatted text files.

In this case, "well-formatted" is kind of ambiguous. The generator will work on most any plaintext. However, to see the best results, I would suggest formatting the files such that each line is a single sentence with a period at the end. There can be an arbitrary amount of blank lines, these will not be processed by the chain.

For testing purposes, I have been downloading plaintext files of books from [Project Gutenberg](http://gutenberg.org/wiki/Main_Page) and using a series of vim commands to format the files how I want. The most useful commands have been the following:

`:%s/.\zs\n\ze./` which finds all newline characters surrounded by a regular character and eliminates the newline; and
`:%s/\.\ /\.\r/g` which finds all periods that precede a space and turns that space into a newline.

Of course, you can use whatever means you wish to achieve the desired formatting.

---------------------------------------

## Compilation and Execution

To run the generator, first compile it with `make`, then you can run several different make targets or execute manually.

To print output to stdout (which is the default), you can use `make run` or `./markovbook -s` or `./markovbook --stdout`
To output a formatted LaTeX document, you can use `make book` or `./markovbook -l` or `./markovbook --latex`

- Running `make book` will also automatically run `pdflatex` so be sure to have that installed unless you want to compile it some other way.
- Also keep in mind that LaTeX likes to throw a fit about characters with certain encodings, so document compilation may fail. Pay attention to the encoding of the characters in your corpus material. Sometimes you may just need to run the program a few times until LaTeX stops complaining.

Finally, to output a help message that gives you flags and switches, use `make help` or `./markovbook -h` or `./markovbook --help`

## Examples

Below are a few examples of what this program might output to the console. In this case, my corpus is comprised of formatted passages from several [Project Gutenberg](http://gutenberg.org/wiki/Main_Page) books, including but not limited to __IBM 1401 Programming Systems__, __Making a Rock Garden__, __The Early History of the Airplane__, and __The Most Sentimental Man__.
